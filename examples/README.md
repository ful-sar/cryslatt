Remember that the directory which contains the cryslatt.sh file, as well the fit.py one, must contain also a subdirectory called REFDIR which hosts the prototypical input files of the systems, in the form <system_name>.SAVE

In this directory, you can find some examples. Each subdirectory (e.g. Na) contains the input directory (Na/REFDIR/Na.SAVE), as well as the commands to execute the script (run_HF.info and run_genisi.info) and their outputs (cryslatt.HF.log and cryslatt.ACM-genisi-metal-hpc.log)
