cryslatt performs the lattice parameter optimization of a crystal using the Boys-Bernardi counterpoise correction.

It may be used for both Hartree-Fock (HF) or Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and employs the quantum chemistry program CRYSTAL.

Calculations are launched using the external Python script ACMxc (available here https://github.com/e-fabiano/acmxc).

Further information can be found in the cryslatt_manual.pdf file

Some examples are located in the examples directory
